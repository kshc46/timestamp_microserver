Welcome to my first node.js and express app!

This app does one thing, takes an argument via the url. If this argument is a
date or timestamp, it returns both the date and unix timestamp as a simple JSON.

**sidenote... calls MongoDB, but doesn't actually use MongoDB. Just practicing
the basic setup if I were to use it.
